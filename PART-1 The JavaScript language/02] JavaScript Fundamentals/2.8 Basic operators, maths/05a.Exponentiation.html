    <title>Exponentiation **</title>

  <body>
    <p>Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.

For example, a square root is an exponentiation by Â½:</p>
    <script>
      "use strict";
      alert(`power of 1/2 is the same as a square root : ${4 ** (1/2)}`); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
      alert(`power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root : ${8 ** (1/3)}`); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)

     document.write(`power of 1/2 is the same as a square root : ${4 ** (1/2)}`); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
     document.write("<br>");
     document.write(`power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root : ${8 ** (1/3)}`); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)
    </script>
    </script>
  </body>
