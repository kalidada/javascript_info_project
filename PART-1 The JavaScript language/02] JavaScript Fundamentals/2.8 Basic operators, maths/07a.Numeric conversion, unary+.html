      The need to convert strings to numbers arises very often. For example, if
      we are getting values from HTML form fields, they are usually strings.
      What if we want to sum them?
    </p>
    <p>The binary plus would add them as strings:</p>

    <script>
      "use strict";
      let apples = "2";
      let oranges = "3";

      alert(`Adding two numbers as string e.g. "2" & "3" will concatenate them, not tha actual SUM:: ${apples + oranges}`); // "23", the binary plus concatenates strings
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
