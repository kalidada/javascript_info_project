    <title>String concatenation with binary +</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their
      operands to numbers.
    </p>
    <script>
      "use strict";
      alert(`Substraction of (6 - "2") will convert string to numbers :: ${6 - "2"}`); // 4, converts '2' to a number
      alert(`Division both the string will convert both ("6" / "2") to number:: ${"6" / "2"}`); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
    </script>
  </body>
