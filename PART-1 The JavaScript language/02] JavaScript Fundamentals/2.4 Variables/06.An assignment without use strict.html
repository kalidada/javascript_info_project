    <title>An assignment without use strict</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      // note: no "use strict" in this example

      num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist

      alert(num); // 5
    </script>
     <p>Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using let. This still works now if we donâ€™t put use strict in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old scripts.</p>
