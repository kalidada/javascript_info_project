<body>
    <p>There is a list of reserved words, which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself.</p>

<p>For example: let, class, return, and function are reserved.</p>

<p>The code below gives a syntax error:</p>

<script>
    "use strict";

    let let = 5; //can't name a variable "let", error!
    let return = 5; //also can't name it "return", error!
</script>
</body>
