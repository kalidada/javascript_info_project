    <p>The notation is shorter than the equivalent if statement, which appeals to some programmers. But it is less readable.

Here is the same code using if for comparison:</p>

<script>
    let company =prompt('Which company created JavaScript', ' ');
    if(company=='Netscape'){
        alert('Right!');
    }else{
        alert('wrong');
    }

</script>
</body>
