    <p>Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:</p>

    <p>Please note that this can only be done in backticks. Other quotes don’t have this embedding functionality!</p>
    <script>
        "use strict";
        alert("the result is $(1 + 2)" ); // the result is ${1 + 2} (double quotes do nothing)
