      As we can see, the result is always true except for the case when both
      operands are false. If an operand is not a boolean, itâ€™s converted to a
      boolean for the evaluation. For instance, the number 1 is treated as true,
      the number 0 as false:

    <script>
      "use strict";

      if (1 || 0) {
        // works just like if( true || false )
        alert("truthy!");
      }
    </script>
  </body>
